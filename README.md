Problems of beta<br>
1.Obvious latency.<br> 
2.Uncomplete sub-systems built, especially player's skill system.<br> 
3.No docker use.<br> 
4.Uncertain moving maximum players simutaneously.<br> 
5.Reduncy of design speed down performance.<br>
6.Multi-instance operations of server and load balancer from Google Cloud and Alibabalcoud(Unsure).<br>
7.Deploying from local to cloud. Upgrade from beta to stable with templating and bug fix.<br>
8.Standardized development syntax.<br>
9.Own content creations.<br>
10.Cost calculation.<br>
11.Design around by enhancing uniqueness.
